# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  - The prompts for this final CFU were entertaining, and definitely increased in challenge. Thankfully, all the aspects relating to past lessons I benefited from the repetition the past CFU submissions had. Any piece that required outside searching, I was weary. Some code I believed could work ended up being too complex, or did not give the desired result. That was a productive struggle and yielded it's own learning: experience troubleshooting and searching for answers.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  - I've started to practice ways to reach stopping points, and then resume without wasting too much time "getting back up to speed". Comments are very helpful, in the Git Commit stage, and in the code itself. I also make checklists in the trello board so I know that I've made progress, and that what's left isn't _too daunting_.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  - I think I will experiment with ways to "storyboard" or "pseudocode" before or during challenges. That way I can fully visualize the working pieces that I need to create, how they relate, and explore the possible errors that can happen during it. Coding in a linear fashion has been _okay_ for the time being, but as projects get larger and more complex, a roadmap to success feels critical.
